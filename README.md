#TicTacToe

TicTacToe Bot using over 120 if-else statements. Unbeatable when playing first and almost always unbeatable when playing second.
The Game Tree needed to be mapped in order to lessen the game states possible which had to be iterated using the if-else statements. 
There is one condition in which the human would win playing first to make the game worth giving a try. 
Try it out and let me know what you think about it!
Kudos!
